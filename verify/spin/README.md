# SPIN models of the mill coordination design

Small models of two parts of the mill, written in the `spin` input language
and checked with the `spin` model checker (from the 1991 book on designing and
validating computer protocols that introduced it).
A test checks the cases someone wrote down. A model check tries every order
in which the steps of the model can interleave, inside the stated bounds.

| File | What it models |
| :--- | :--- |
| `wake.pml` | the wake path: push queue, webhook POST, the wake lease (card 886: ended by `mill wake-done` or its timeout, not by a connect), the trailing POST (#669), the one immediate retry, connect sync, the seat rule (supersede, `-r` 4409); plus card 827's proposed backoff retry, and the fixes for cards 831 and 832 (shipped; their switches default on) |
| `holds.pml` | `mill hold` / `mill drop` (refuse at once, no TTL, only the owner drops, reset and retire free a desk's holds), with three desk policies for what to do after a refusal |
| `run.sh` | runs every check with fixed flags, compares each result with its expectation, exits nonzero on any difference or tool error (`--strict`: on any violation) |
| `SKILL.md` | how the next agent tells whether a change touches the modelled code, reruns the checks, and updates the models |

Run: `verify/spin/run.sh` (about three and a half minutes, up to 4 GB of memory; needs `spin` 6.5.x and a C
compiler). One check with its trail: `verify/spin/run.sh W07`.

All searches are exhaustive (no `-DBITSTATE`, no depth cut). Liveness checks
run with weak fairness (`pan -a -f`): every process that can always move
eventually moves. The receiver's choice to fail a POST is not covered by
fairness; it is bounded by `MAXFAIL`, the most POSTs in a row it may fail.

## Properties and results (models at commit 39f2507, the head of PR #216, card 886)

Wake path, one desk, two or three items:

| Property | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| One wake per lease: a second wake starts only after `mill wake-done` or the lease timeout (`wake_lease_s`, 900 s), never after a connect | proved (W01-W03, L03; W02 with one connect per run, more runs out of memory); fails on a mutation that splits the gate take (M01); **violated** by the pre-886 design, where a connect frees the gate while the run is still working and a second POST lands (L02, the storm) |
| A wake-done ends only the lease that woke its own run | **violated** (L01): a run that outlives its lease says done after the timeout and a newer wake; `lease_done` pops whatever lease is current, ending the newer run's lease early |
| No invalid end state (deadlock) | proved (W01-W03) |
| No queued item is taken off the queue without reaching the desk | proved on main: one connect at a time (W04), a refused second connect, now the default (W06), a `--take` connect that supersedes (W05, W18, W21); the 831 fix alone with three items (W19); **violated** by the pre-831 order, take then send (W23) |
| Every item is eventually delivered | **violated** on main with a perfect receiver (W07, card 886 finding below); proved with emits atomic, which hides that race (W09, L04); fails on a mutation where wake-done sends no trailing POST (M06); proved for the 832 fix under the pre-886 gate (W14, W15) and with two connects (W22); **violated** when both POSTs of a wake fail (W08); **violated** by the pre-832 order, POST then queue (W24); fails on a mutation of the 832 fix that marks a row sent at hand-off (M04) |
| Both fixes keep one wake per window and add no invalid end state | proved (W20) |
| Card 827 retry, bounded at 2 retries (6 POSTs) | proved when at most 5 POSTs in a row fail (W12, W16); violated at 6 (W13) and for a receiver down forever (W17) |

Holds, two or three desks each needing two locks in a cycle:

| Property | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mutual exclusion | proved (H01, H02); fails without `FOR UPDATE` (M03) |
| The mill itself never blocks (no invalid end state) | proved (H03): `mill hold` refuses, it never waits |
| No deadlock as a busy loop, keep-and-retry policy | **violated** (H04, H05) |
| No livelock, drop-all-and-retry policy | **violated** (H06) |
| No deadlock or livelock, one global lock order | proved (H07, H08) |
| No starvation | **violated** (H09): no queue, a desk can lose every race; proved for finite work (H10) |
| A dead desk's holds | **violated** while nobody resets it (H11): no TTL; proved once someone runs `mill reset` or `mill retire` on it (H12), and the release keeps mutual exclusion (H13); fails on a mutation where reset keeps the holds (M05) |

## Findings in the code's words

Findings 9 and 10 are new with the wake lease (card 886, PR #216) and are open.

9. **Done between the peek and the trail (W07).** `post_desk` reads
   `_gate_open` under the lock, releases it, and later calls `_coalesced`,
   which takes the lock again and returns when `_GATE` has no entry. If the
   run's `mill wake-done` lands in between, `lease_done` pops the lease with
   no held-back items (so no trailing POST), and `_coalesced` then finds no
   lease and records nothing. The row waits in the queue with no wake until
   another item or connect comes. Before 886 the same gap closed itself,
   because the connect that cleared the gate read the queue in the same sync.
10. **A stale wake-done (L01).** `lease_done` pops `_GATE[desk]` whatever
   lease is there. A run that takes longer than the lease (900 s) and says
   done after a newer wake went out ends that newer run's lease: the next
   item POSTs while the newer run is still working, which is the overlap the
   lease exists to stop. Long passes outlive 900 s in practice.

Findings 1 to 3 are fixed on main (cards 831 and 832); they are kept as
the record of what W23 and W24 still catch.

1. **Fixed by card 832. Row queued after the wake (W24, was W07).** `emit` and `fanout` read
   `HUB.rooms`, call `post_desk`, and only then `rec_push.put`
   (push.py 565-587, 453-489). A woken run can connect and sync in between
   (likely when the first POST times out after the receiver got it, and the
   immediate retry takes up to 8 s more). Its sync finds no row, clears the
   window, and the row lands after it: no later POST, the desk never hears of
   the item until something else connects it.
2. **Sitting read vs. leave (W07 with `PUTFIRST`).** An item that finds the
   desk sitting gets no POST; if the desk's last socket leaves before the
   broadcast or the desk's next sync, the row waits with no wake.
   `PUTFIRST` + `RING_ON_LEAVE` close both races (W14-W16). They model the
   card 832 fix as coded: the row goes in as missed first, a live frame that
   reached a socket marks it sent (a later step), and the last socket leaving,
   or a frame that found no socket, rings when a missed row that rings waits.
   Marking the row sent at hand-off instead strands the item (M04).
3. **Fixed by card 831. Take before send (W23, was W05).** `connect_sync_frame` deletes the rows
   (`mill_push_take`) and the handler sends the frame after (asgi.py 609-616).
   A newer connect of the same desk supersedes the old socket in between; the
   old send fails and those rows are gone. Any failed send after the take
   does the same; a command reply (asgi.py 633-636) has the same order.
   sync.md says "A deleted list is not sent again"; connect.md says
   "Nothing is lost". `ACK_AFTER_SEND` models the card 831 fix: the sync reads
   the rows, sends, then deletes exactly those; an unsent frame deletes
   nothing (W18, W19, W21). A put-back on a failed send was not chosen: it
   still deletes first, so a row is in neither place until the put-back.
4. **A failed wake is two back-to-back POSTs, then nothing (W08).** The window
   is taken before the POST (wake.py 636), so after a failure only a trailing
   POST can follow, and only if another item arrives inside the window. The
   docs (connect.md, wake.py docstring) say "a burst is never left asleep".
5. **Card 827 needs a job id (M02).** A retry must stop only its own chain;
   otherwise a late success of an old retry cancels the chain of a newer
   failed wake. Bounded retries prove delivery only under a bounded-loss
   assumption: fewer lost POSTs in a row than the budget has POSTs.
6. **Wall restart (W11).** `_GATE`, `_TRAIL` and the timer threads are memory
   only: a restart can send a second POST inside the lease, and drops a pending
   trailing POST (rows survive in `push_queue`).
7. **Receipts never ring (W10).** By design (push.py 573); a receipt waits
   for the desk's next connect.
8. **Holds.** No TTL. Since card 842, `mill reset` and `mill retire` free
   the desk's holds in the same call (`mill_hold_release_desk`); a
   superseded connect and a clock-out leave them held. No queue: starvation possible.
   Agents that need two locks must take them in one global order, and must
   not spin on a refused hold.

## The fix switches and current main

`LEASE` (card 886, PR #216) defaults to 1, and `MULTI` (a run connects once
per shell call) follows it. `LEASE=0` is the pre-886 gate, cleared by every
connect sync; W14-W16, W19, W22 and W24 pin it, since they check the 831 and
832 fixes on their own. L02 keeps the pre-886 storm failing.

`ACK_AFTER_SEND` (card 831, #168) and `PUTFIRST` + `RING_ON_LEAVE` (card 832,
#169) shipped in 0.7.16, and their defaults are 1: the plain checks describe
main. W05 and W07 now expect pass. W23 and W24 set the switches to 0 and must
still fail, so the models still catch the old orders. A switch set to 0 is
the pre-fix code, not an option on main.

## What is not modelled

- Card 886: `mill wake-done` while the run's own connect still sits (the
  routine wrapper runs commands inside its connect): a trailing POST can go
  out to a desk that is sitting. The model says done after the last leave.
- Card 886: `pending_count`, `last_note` and the note redaction: they shape
  the POST body and decide no POST. `lease_synced` only resets that count.
- Card 886 with three items and more than one connect per run: out of memory
  on the run host; W02 and W04 run three items with one connect per run.

- Time beyond "the window has ended or not"; the 30-day expiry sweep.
- A crash between a commit and its `after_commit` pokes (push.py 421, 550):
  the row is never queued.
- The client's 256-frame sit buffer and `note_drop` put-back.
- `--wake-on addressed`, the default since card 836 (room-only items skip the POST), refused or
  non-public URLs (no window taken), the join test POST (never takes a window).
- InnoDB. Two first-time holds of a new resource can deadlock on gap locks
  (1213); #818 retries once (records/db.py 193-199, 498-520) and the unique
  `idx_hold` keeps one owner. The model treats each stored procedure as one step.
- A receiver that answers 2xx is assumed to start a run that connects.
- Card 834's busy rule on the client: `connect` refuses a held seat by
  default and looks again after 1 s and 2 s. The model's `REFUSE` is the
  server side of it (W06); `SESSIONS=2` without `REFUSE` is `--take`, or an
  old client.
- Card 838's failure count (`wake._FAILS`, memory only) and its Admin
  letter: they report failed POSTs and add no POST, so delivery is unchanged.
- A reset or retire of a desk whose session is still running: the model
  frees holds only of a dead desk.
- Both fixes with three items and two connects: the search ran out of memory
  on the run host; W19 checks the 831 fix alone at that size.
